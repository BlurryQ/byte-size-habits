## Project Summary

ByteSize Habits is a modern web application designed to help users track their daily habits and personal goals, with a playful, Tamagotchi-style interface. Created using React, Next.js, and styled with TailwindCSS and DaisyUI, the app allows users to set goals, track progress, and interact with a cute, tech-themed character.

To use the app, simply log in as one of the users, for example, “mooDeng.” Once logged in, you can access the homepage, where you’ll find your habit-tracking dashboard. The app offers customizable features such as goal setting, a progress tracker, and a streak counter. Users can also view their personal stats and interact with the character by feeding it memory cards as they complete habits.
